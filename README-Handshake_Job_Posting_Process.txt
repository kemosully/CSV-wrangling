Handshake_Job_Posting_Process.exe

-------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
This program takes two files that are exports from Handshake and
joins them so there is an employer ID for every job posting. 
It processes the student school years column so that just the 
minimum academic level is in a column.

The combined and cleaned file is saved as a tab delimited text file
in the same directory as the two files originated.

-------------------------------------------------
Instructions:

The Handshake_Job_Posting_Process.exe file must be saved on your local machine
(within Program Files, Documents, or Desktop is appropriate).

To run the program, double click on the executable file (.exe).

It will take 15-20 seconds for the first window to open.
When the first window opens, it indicates to select the Job Postings file.
Select the appropriate file & press OK.
When the second window opens, it indicates to select the Employer IDs file.
Select the appropriate file & press OK.

When it completes, it will give you a prompt of where the file it created is.
This will not link you directly to the file location, it is simply a text notification.
Select OK & the program will complete.

If you have not selected one or both of the files (e.g. pressed 'Cancel' in the window),
an error message will pop up and the program will end without creating a new file.
